The bitcoin-dev blog is a technical, open-content blog covering Open-Source projects that Bitcoin developers work on.
Over the past years, the number of Bitcoin developers and Open-Source projects has been growing exponentially.
It has gotten impossible to stay up-to-date on these all projects.


These blog posts are for new contributors exploring the breadth of existing projects.
For seasoned developers wanting to get short updates on projects.
For our pseudonymous and anonymous friends who can't or don't want to attend CoreDev, BitDevs, other meetups, and conferences.
For lurkers and the loud Bitcoin-Twitter voices.
**The blog posts are for every interested reader.**


Grant recipients write blog posts to update the grantor and the community on their progress.
Posts are written by long-time Bitcoin Core contributors implementing complex new features.
By new Bitcoin Core developers _'only'_ improving test coverage, by designers making the technical side of Bitcoin more accessible, by students, and by ex-Googler's.
**Everyone can submit a blog post covering their Bitcoin Open-Source project.**
